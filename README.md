# inheratince-classes-app-Rectangle-
Create base class Rectangle and derived classes Parallelogram and Trapezium that inherit from class Rectangle. Base class Rectangle should include: Data members: base, height. A property should provide a get accessor and a set accessor that should validate that base and height are greater than or equal to 0.0; if not, do nothing. The class should provide a constructor that initializes all data members. The class should provide two public methods: Method Area that will display area of rectangle (a = base * height). Method Shape that will display the name of the shape. Override the ToString method to return the information of the class.  Derived class Parallelogram should inherit the functionality of Rectangle, but it will also include: Parallelogram’s constructor should receive the base, height. Override the method Shape to display the appropriate name of the shape.  Derived class Trapezium should inherit the functionality of Rectangle, but it will include also: A private data member of type float that represent the base2. A property should provide a get accessor and a set accessor that should validate that base2 is greater than or equal to 0.0; if not, do nothing. Trapezium’s constructor should receive the base, height, and base2. Override the Shape to display the appropriate name of the shape. Override the Area to calculate the area of trapezium.  a = (base+base2 / 2) * height Override the ToString method to return the information of the class.  After defining the classes in this hierarchy, write an app that creates an array of Rectangle of size 5; where 1 of elements is an object of class rectangle, 2 of elements are objects of class Parallelogram and last 2 elements in array are  objects of class trapezium. Then test your classes by calling the shape and area methods.

Method Shape that will display the name of the shape.
Override the ToString method to return the information of the class.

Derived class Parallelogram should inherit the functionality of Rectangle, but it
will also include:
Parallelogram’s constructor should receive the base, height.
Override the method Shape to display the appropriate name of the shape.

Derived class Trapezium should inherit the functionality of Rectangle, but it will
include also:

A property should provide a get accessor and a set accessor that should validate that
base2 is greater than or equal to 0.0; if not, do nothing.
Trapezium’s constructor should receive the base, height, and base2.
Override the Shape to display the appropriate name of the shape.
Override the Area to calculate the area of trapezium.

a = (base+base2 / 2) * height
Override the ToString method to return the information of the class.

After defining the classes in this hierarchy, write an app that creates an array of
Rectangle of size 5; where 1 of elements is an object of class rectangle, 2 of
elements are objects of class Parallelogram and last 2 elements in array are

objects of class trapezium. Then test your classes by calling the shape and area
methods.
